## P3: What is an ideal teacher like

What is an ideal teacher like? The ideal teacher may be young or old, tall or short, fat or thin. He should know his subject. He can make mistakes, but he is willing to learn. His personality is as important as his scholarship. The ideal teacher must be **enthusiastic**. He must never teach anything he himself is not interested in.

He should be a bit of an actor, and he should not be afraid to show his feelings and express his likes and dislikes. He must like his students and respect them, but he must also respect himself and be proud of his work. Otherwise, he cannot respect his students and win respect from them. The ideal teacher should have an understanding of his students, and be able to **relate to** them.

He needs students understanding too. The ideal teacher should be kind, encouraging and helpful. He is neither too strict nor too friendly. His attitude and **approach** towards his students should be in between these two **extremes**. The teacher should motivate the student too, so that he wants to learn. He needs patience and understanding, and must encourage the student without **pushing** or forcing him.

The ideal teacher should see his students as individuals and recognise their differences. He must know how to encourage the self development and **growth** of each of his students. The ideal teacher is one who grows, learns and improves himself along with his students.


## P4T1

Morning, this is **TGC**. Good morning, Walter Barry here, calling from London. Could I speak to Mr. Grand, please? Who's calling, please? Walter Barry, from London. What is it about, please? Well, I understand that your company has a chemical **processing plant**. My own company, **LCP**, Liquid Control Products, is a leader in safety from **leaks** in the field of chemical processing.

I would like to speak to Mr. Grand to discuss ways in which we could help TGC protect itself from such problems and save money at the same time. Yes, I see. Well, Mr. Grand is not **available** at the moment. Can you tell me when I could reach him? He's very busy for the next few days. Then he'll be away in New York, so it's difficult to give you a time.

Could I speak to someone else, perhaps? Who in particular? A **colleague**, for example? You're speaking to his personal assistant. I can deal with calls from Mr. Grand. Yes, well, could I **ring** him tomorrow? No, I'm sorry, he won't be free tomorrow. Listen, let me suggest something. You send us details of your products and services, together with **references** from other companies, and then we'll contact you.

Yes, that's very kind of you. I have your address. Very good, Mr... Barry. Walter Barry from LCP in London. Right, Mr. Barry. We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye.

## P4T2

Gosh, have you seen this, Richard? Seen what? In the paper. It says there's a man going round, pretending he's from the **electricity board**. He's been calling at people's homes, saying he's come to check that all their **appliances** are safe. Then he **gets around them** to make him a cup of tea, and while they're out of the room, he steals their money, handbag, whatever, and **makes off with** it.

But you know, Jane, it's partly their own fault. You should never let anyone like that in unless you're expecting them. It's all very well to say that, but someone comes to the door and says, electricity or gas, and you **automatically** think they're okay. Especially if they **flash** a card at you. Does this man have an **ID** then?

Yes, that's just it. It seems he used to work for the electricity board at one time. According to the paper, the police are warning people, especially **pensioners**, not to admit anyone unless they have an appointment. It's a bit sad. One old lady told them she'd just been to the post office to draw her **pension** when he called.

She said he must have followed her home. He stole **the whole lot**. But what does he look like? Surely they must have a description. Oh, yes, they have. Let's see. In his thirties, tall, **bushy** dark hair, **slight** **northern accent**. Sounds a bit like you, actually.
