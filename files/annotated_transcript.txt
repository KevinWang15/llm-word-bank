He changed our lives. Steve Jobs had a [1.vision]. It's like the world lost to [2.John Lennon]. He demanded perfection. He could [3.rip into] people, be tough to work for, and led a technological revolution. The personal computer. A [4.light bulb] goes off, and he says, Wow, I can put computers on every desktop.

The iPod. When they first came out, people were like, oh my God, they're so [5.sleek], they're so sexy. It was new. It was small. I had to have it. The iPhone, I have an iPhone, which is an [6.extension] of me, and I love using the iPad. People didn't know they wanted it or needed it, and it [7.turned out] they did. It's kinda like, well, we're gonna make a [8.portable] music player.

I need that. We're gonna make a phone. I need that. We're gonna make a [9.toaster]. I need that.

I genius now, Steve.

Do you have to be a difficult person, a tough person, to be a genius? I don't know the answer to that. He was very [10.dictatorial]. He was very clever. He had a very clear sense of his own [11.gut], his own [12.instinct]. He was [13.abrasive], he was [14.brash], he thought he knew everything. But the products he created were not [15.elitist], even though they were super cool.

All around the world, people love these products. What did Frank Perdue say? It takes a tough man to make a tender bird?

Say what you want, but Steve Jobs was the guy who [16.envisioned] a computer on every desk. An [17.earbud] in every ear, and a [18.device] that would take [19.multitasking] to a whole new level. He didn't just envision, he made it happen. And he is calling it iPhone. He was about [20.humanizing] technology in a way that made it extraordinarily easy, intuitive, and an absolute joy and pleasure to use.

His gut instinct was his genius, and it's absolutely unteachable. Genius is not about making complicated things. It's about making [21.complicated] things very simple. Making things simple and beautiful. That was the genius of Steve Jobs from the very start. He was born in 1955 to a pair of unmarried graduate students, [22.intellectuals], who [23.put him up for] [24.adoption].

He grew up with a loving working class couple in California's Silicon Valley. Just like Harry Potter, Steve Jobs realized that he was a [25.wizard], even though he was being raised by [26.muggles]. He was a [27.hybrid]. One part [28.geek], one part [29.hippie]. It was the 60s. When he was a teenager, he met a fellow [30.techie]. A [31.hacker] named Steve Wozniak.

They [32.whiled away] the hours [33.tinkering with] electronics in the Jobs house. In 1972, Jobs [34.headed up to] Oregon, where he attended a small [35.liberal arts] college. He turned on, [36.tuned in], and [37.dropped out]. He listened to the Beatles and Bob Dylan. Took [38.LSD]. Went to India. When he returned to Silicon Valley in 1975, it was the [39.dawn] of the computer age, and Steve Jobs had a vision.

The very first Steve Jobs computer was actually the [40.brainchild] of his friend, Steve Wozniak. Woz did the [41.wiring], Jobs did the dreaming. And [42.behold], the Apple I. No power supply, no [43.casing], just a beginning. Jobs imagined a machine for the people, and he [44.sensed] he was the man to make it happen. The two Steves found an [45.investor], and formed Apple Computer, [46.Inc.]

The name Apple, the friendly shape, the friendly advertising we did, as Steve was a genius at marketing, that it helped bring this whole [47.category] of device to the world. Apple I [48.morphed into] Apple II, which went further. It was faster. It had [49.text display], color [50.graphics], and its own plastic casing. It was the first personal computer that a human being, a normal human being, a non technically oriented human being could use.

I think Steve Jobs knew that he [51.was onto something] big. Real big. But the revolution was about to be [52.sparked] on the tail of something quite small. The mouse. It was so simple. Jobs didn't invent it, he reinvented it. Reinventing, making stuff better, would become his career long [53.M.O.]. Meanwhile, Apple II sales are [54.robust].

The company goes public in 1980, and Steve Jobs... is suddenly worth $200 million. Hadn't happened before for a 25 year old to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars when he was still young. He was [55.dashingly] good looking. He was this new symbol of [56.entrepreneurship].
