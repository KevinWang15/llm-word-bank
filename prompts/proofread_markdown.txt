Here is my word bank explanation. Each entry is the word, followed by 词性 and 中文含义, followed by the sentence where the word appeared.

Help me proofread each entry (词性 and 中文含义).

Don't print anything about the entry, if you don't think there's a mistake.
Otherwise, explain in detail what the mistakes are, and offer a correction.
