<h1>Part 2 Text 1 Task 1</h1>

<p>In 1848, the London Illustrated News published this <strong>engraving</strong> of the royal family standing by the first Christmas tree most English had ever seen. In just a few years, a decorated <strong>fir</strong> could be found in nearly every English home at Christmas. Within a few years, if you look at Victorian <strong>diaries</strong> or letters, people are saying, We had a Christmas tree as is <strong>customary</strong>. Or we had a Christmas tree as we have always had. Of course, there hadn't always had one at all. It is a custom which had started in the 1840s. By the late 1850s, people believed that The Christmas tree was part of the English Christmas.</p>

<p>Americans <strong>embraced</strong> the Christmas tree just as quickly as the English had. In fact, its connection to the old world was one of its strongest <strong>selling points</strong>. For a lot of Americans, these are going to be new holiday traditions, not something their parents are into, especially in the case of the more austere / <strong>moralist</strong> <strong>Protestants</strong>. So they're looking for a reason for what they're doing. And one of the most convenient reasons they can have is they can say, well, this is the way it's done in Germany, or this is the way it's done... in England.</p>

<p><strong>All of a sudden</strong>, Christmas traditions were <strong>popping up</strong> everywhere. In 1828, Joel R. Poinsett, America's minister to Mexico, brought back a green and red plant that seemed perfect for the new holiday. And in 1843, the English firm of J. C. Horsley printed the first Christmas card. A newly efficient <strong>postal</strong> service in England and America helped make Christmas cards an overnight sensation.</p>

<p>It seemed as though every <strong>vestige</strong> of the old <strong>Bacchanalian</strong> Christmas was gone. But even the Victorians couldn't clean up Christmas completely. Victorians were particularly <strong>keen</strong> on <strong>mistletoe</strong>, because of course you could actually kiss a lady. Or a lady could kiss a man that normally, in the normal <strong>course of event</strong>, would not be allowed to kiss.</p>

<p>So in a society which was fairly strict, one <strong>vestige</strong> of that <strong>licentious</strong> Christmas from earlier times is the <strong>Sprig</strong> of Mistletoe. No Victorian Christmas <strong>gathering</strong> was without it.</p>

<p>By mid-century, Christmas was everywhere in America. In the streets, in the homes, in the marketplace. The one place you could not find Christmas was in church. Most Americans were <strong>Protestant</strong>, and the Protestant church had ignored Christmas for years. But Protestant Victorians longed for official religion on this <strong>sacred</strong> day.</p>

<p>What a number of them did <strong>initially</strong> is say, Well, if we can't find a Christmas service in our <strong>Baptist</strong> church or our Presbyterian church, let's go see what the Catholics are doing, or let's go see what the <strong>Episcopalians</strong> are doing. And increasingly that puts pressure on these <strong>latter-day</strong> <strong>Puritans</strong> to have Christmas services, because there's a way in which <strong>lay</strong> people begin to expect it.</p>

<p>Church services, mistletoe, and Christmas trees. America's new holiday now seemed firmly <strong>in place</strong>. But Victorian America had one last contribution to the Christmas season. A <strong>jolly</strong> elf who <strong>shimmied</strong> down the chimney would soon <strong>personify</strong> Christmas for generations <strong>to come</strong>.</p>

<p>5 Weirdest Christmas Traditions</p>

<h3>Number 5: A Christmas <strong>Remembrance</strong>, Finland.</h3>

<p>On Christmas Eve, families often visit the <strong>graves</strong> of their <strong>ancestors</strong> to light candles in the memory of <strong>the deceased</strong>. Even if families do not have their ancestors graves nearby them, they will still <strong>leave out</strong> candles in nearby <strong>graveyards</strong> that honour their ancestors who are <strong>buried</strong> elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Number 4: Let the <strong>Goat</strong> Live Until Christmas, Sweden.</h3>

<p>In 1996, a 13-metre tall goat <strong>figure</strong> made out of <strong>straw</strong> was built in the town of Gävle. At the <strong>stroke</strong> of midnight on Christmas Eve, the goat went up in <strong>flames</strong>. However, the town never stopped building the goat, year after year. By 2011, the goat had been burnt down 25 times. The burning of the <strong>Gävle</strong> goat happened so often that <strong>bookmakers</strong> began taking <strong>bets</strong> on the <strong>survival</strong> of the goat 1988.</p>

<h3>Number 3: <strong>Toss</strong> your shoe and <strong>get hitched</strong>. Czech Republic and Slovakia.</h3>

<p>This tradition is very similar to the wedding tradition where brides would throw their <strong>bouquet</strong> and whoever caught the bouquet would be the next person to get married. However, in Czech and Republic and Slovakia, this involves a shoe, and it needs to be on Christmas day. The person would stand with their back towards the door and then throw their shoe over their shoulder. If the shoe <strong>lands</strong> with the <strong>toe</strong> pointing towards the door, then that person is then <strong>deemed</strong> to be married soon.</p>

<h3>Number 2: Go Bananas with Christmas, India.</h3>

<p>In India, only 2.3 percent of the population are <strong>Christians</strong>, but if you think about that, it's an enormous amount of people considering their population. In fact, that's about 25 million people. Instead of celebrating Christmas with the normal Christmas trees made out of <strong>fir</strong> or <strong>pine</strong> to decorate, they use banana trees and even <strong>mango</strong> trees.</p>

<h3>Number 1: Kentucky for Christmas, Japan.</h3>

<p>Instead of the usual <strong>turkey</strong> Christmas dinner, the Japanese <strong>feast on</strong> the <strong>Colonel</strong>'s Kentucky Fried Chicken, all thanks to a <strong>campaign</strong> in 1974. KFC has been <strong>associated</strong> with Christmas in the minds of the Japanese for generations, a tradition passed from parent to child. More than 240,000 <strong>barrels</strong> of chicken will be sold during Christmas, five to ten times normal <strong>monthly</strong> sales.</p>

<h1>Part 2 Text 2 Task 2</h1>

<p>Today, more than 10 percent of all Americans can <strong>trace</strong> their <strong>ancestry</strong> back to the Mayflower.</p>

<p>For a time, Plymouth provides the <strong>sanctuary</strong> they sought.</p>

<p>But like Jamestown, there were others here first.</p>

<p>April 1621. The Pilgrims have been in the New World for five months. <strong>Barely</strong> half survived the first winter. But they're not the first Europeans to arrive on this coast. Five years before, European ships brought <strong>light skinned</strong> people and <strong>plague</strong>. Almost nine out of ten of the local people are <strong>wiped out</strong>.</p>

<p>The Poconoke people don't need enemies. They make peace with the <strong>Pilgrims</strong>. They teach the English how to grow crops in <strong>sandy</strong> soil, using fish for <strong>fertilizer</strong>.</p>

<p>But they want something in return. They have a common enemy, a <strong>rival</strong> tribe, and the English have powerful weapons.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims aren't soldiers, but in the New World, they have to fight to survive.</p>

<p>On August 14th, 1621, Pilgrims and Poconoket, shoulder to shoulder, will launch a surprise attack that will <strong>seal</strong> their future in this new land.</p>

<p>"It was <strong>resolved</strong> to send 14 men, <strong>well-armed</strong>, and to <strong>fall upon</strong> them in the night. The captain gave <strong>charge</strong>. Let none pass out."</p>

<p>The rival tribe doesn't know what hit them. Surrounded, they have no answer for English <strong>firepower</strong>. Poconoket and Pilgrims find common ground, and a chance to survive.</p>
