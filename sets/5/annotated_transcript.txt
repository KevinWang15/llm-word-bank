# An interview with Kobe Bryant

Next guest is [1.a true man of his word]. Last time he was here, it was our first show. And he said he would return with the NBA championship [2.trophy]. Here today, it's our 100th show!

From your 2010 world champion Los Angeles Lakers, [3.the NBA Finals MVP], number 24, Kobe Bryant!

If you guys don't know, George is at Game 7 going crazy. I want to give you a shirt that [4.symbolizes] our [5.Cinco] titles. Ahhhhh! you we're right, man. Told you we were right. How are we doing? Cinco! I can't believe that, man. Alright. Let's move on. Where do I put this? Just put it right there. Okay. First of all, Harvey gave everybody in our audience a Nike All Together Now t shirt created especially for the NBA Finals, so everybody's...

I got... Listen, I've been a Laker fan my whole life. I'm older than you from before you were born. First of all, I never thought that I would see my [6.reflection] in [7.the Larry O'Brien trophy] in all of my life. That's what it is, man. That's it. That's what it's all about. That's what it. I've seen Wilt Chamberlain play. I saw Kareem Abdul Jabbar play. I was in high school when Magic was a [8.rookie]. Through the 80s, through the 90s, and I want to say something because we're friends, but as a fan, you are... The greatest Laker who has ever played.

Okay. Cinco. Tu sabes cinco. Cinco. To you, what is this one? This one [9.rank]? It's, uh, to me, it's number one.

The challenge that the Celtics presented to us. I mean, they were an incredible team and then, you know, to [10.beatdown] 3-2, and them and them just be one game away from getting that championship. And then us getting the last two of them, it just, it just makes everything worthwhile.

And, and, game seven at home, you've been playing, you've never heard, [11.Staple center] like that right here. No, no, you know, you know, it's funny is that for the first three and a half [12.quarters]. I mean the whole place I mean you can actually this is not a sound but it you actually hear this.

That makes any sense that's what the place sounded like it was just. And then we [13.made a run] and the place just [14.blew up] and uh, I've never quite heard it like that. Did you see my crazy ass running around? I did. You know what? I, I saw it. We're up on a, we're up on a, you know, the little platform that they put up.

And you know, you got the [15.commissioner] there, you got Bill Russell there, and I look over to my left. And I see George Thurgood over there like this.

Yeah! That was awesome. That was awesome. I tell you, I cried three times. I was crying, man. I had my hands in my head. I had my crazy ass pants on. You saw my pants? Dude, I was going to bring that up. I didn't want to, but you know, it's all good. It's all good. So, so, um, uh, when, when the ball came to our side of the [16.court], and you were running after it as time was, was [17.winding down], how was, what's that like?

Uh, that, that right there is the greatest feeling in the world. I mean, Lamar threw the ball and then at that point you just know that there's no chance for him to win and you're just running after the ball. And I'm just like, I just felt, I swear I felt like a little kid, like, you know what I'm saying? It was just like...

It was amazing. It was absolutely amazing. Oh, man, it's such an incredible feeling. And you talk about, you know, people play for a lot of money, but in that [18.instant], you were a little kid running after that ball. You know, at heart, you still have to keep that. Because, you know, you come to the NBA, you're surrounded by all this [19.hype] and all this pressure.

If you lose that [20.innocence], you know, that you had when you were a kid to play the game, then you lose everything. You know, so it's the joy of just playing the game that really fulfills me, and that's just, that's incredible. I love that. I love that about you. I love, I love, you know. I love everything about you.

Speaking of keeping it, staying [21.boyish] here. You took Vanessa and the kids to Disneyland, right? Let's take a picture. Check this out. Paul Pierce still on them.

Now, when you, you, you love, you love [22.amusement parks]. Oh, yeah, I love it. You love Disneyland. Absolutely. Now, do you go on the [23.rides]? Every single one of them. Every single one. [24.Matterhorn]? Uh, Matterhorn. Um, I actually, I'm, I'm scared of the [25.teacups] though. I know, I'm like really like. But tell everybody why.

That [26.spinning] around stuff, man. You know, my, my kid, she wanted to get on it, our youngest one. Let's go on the teacups, teacups. You know, they don't like teacups. No, we gotta do the teacups. Okay, let's go. So, I'm looking at Miha, I'm just looking her right in the face. I'm just spinning the thing around, I'm just doing this.

I don't know, I'm trying not to look at any place else, I'm just staying focused, you know what I mean? Do you [27.fit in] the teacup or are you all like this I fit.

No, let's do it, it's the rides later, let's see, what's the... The most uncomfortable ride is [28.Space Mountain]. I'm sitting there like, Oh, yeah. Oh, exactly. Right. Yeah.

Okay. Everybody's wondering, will Phil Jackson stay as [29.coach], Kobe? You know, I hope so. I talked to him a little bit, um, since. And, um, he's gotta make sure he's healthy and ready to go. I mean, he's been doing this for a long, long time. For a long, long time. So, uh, I think if he feels like he's, you know, physically fit to be able to go at it again, I'm sure he will be.

He has 11 championships. So, you know, I tell him, come on, what's One more! What's one more season? Like, come on, come on. You can do one more. When he stands up, he looks a little bit like [30.Dracula] getting out of the [31.coffin]. You ever see that? right, you're right. It's his whole, that's his whole [32.mystique]. That's his whole, you know, that's his whole [33.Zen] thing. You know what I mean? He really, when you see Phil really walk, you know, he's in practice. You're walking around. How great is that? How great is that? So, so, um, your plans, part of the plans is, you love, uh, soccer.

Oh yeah. You grew up in Italy. Absolutely, yeah. So, you're going to the World Cup. I'm going to the World Cup and, uh, I'm excited to see our USA team. Yes.

And, uh, I'm excited to see them and, uh, yeah, I can't wait, man. I've been a soccer fan forever. So this is like a, this is a big deal for me. This is a big deal for you. This we don't have to tell you is a big deal for every Laker fan.

Thank you for the hundredth show. Congratulations. Enjoy your summer. Now for you all to get your chance to win a Nike all together. The t shirt your NBA. NBA Finals MVP!
