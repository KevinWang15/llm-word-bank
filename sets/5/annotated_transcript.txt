# Part 5: HOMEWORK

The way to complain is to act [1.businesslike] and important. If your complaint is immediate, suppose you got the wrong order at a restaurant. Make a polite but firm request to see the manager. When the manager comes, ask his or her name, and then state your problem and what you expect to have done about it.

Be polite. Shouting or acting rude will [2.get you nowhere], but also be firm in making your complaint. Besides, Act important. This doesn't mean to [3.put on airs] and say, Do you know who I am? What it means is that people are often treated the way they expect to be treated. If you act like someone who expects a fair request to be [4.granted], chances are it will be granted.

The worst way to complain is over the telephone. You are speaking to a voice coming from someone you cannot see, so you can't tell how the person on the line is reacting. It is easy for that person to give you the [5.runaround]. Complaining in person, or by letter, is generally more effective. If your complaint does not require an immediate response, It often helps to complain by letter.

If you have an [6.appliance] that doesn't work, send a letter to the store that sold it. Be businesslike and [7.stick to] the point. Don't spend a paragraph on how your Uncle Joe tried to fix the problem and couldn't.
