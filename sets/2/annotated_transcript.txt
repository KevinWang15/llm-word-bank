# Text 2: Mike Tyson in the news

Tyson has earned 300 million dollars since becoming world [1.heavyweight] champion in 1986, but his [2.outrageously] [3.lavish] lifestyle forced him to declare [4.bankruptcy] just last week. ABC's Robert Crullwich explains how the former champ [5.squandered] his fortune.  To spend 300 million dollars in 17 years, you've got to spend 48,  348 bucks every day.

How did he do that? Robin Givens and Mike Tyson! Well, starting with the ladies, his first divorce from Robin Givens cost 10. 5 million dollars. His second from Monica Turner cost another 6. 5 million, plus she got a house. His houses were [6.high maintenance]. This one, for example, has 61 rooms. 18 bedrooms, 38 bathrooms, 7 kitchens, a disco, indoor [7.racquetball], indoor pool, [8.gym], private [9.screening room], and a [10.master bedroom] with 5 televisions.

[11.Lawn care] alone at 3 of these homes, he says, costs 748, 000.  He liked pets, unusual pets. He bought 2 Siberian tigers, these aren't his, but they cost 70, 000 each and required a [12.trainer]. He liked cars. He had five of these [13.Bentley convertibles] at 320, 000 each. In the late 1980s, he bought 110 cars for himself and his friends.

Then there's Don King, the fight [14.promoter], who he now [15.accuses of] stealing tens of millions of his [16.earnings]. The two are [17.suing] each other, which means, of course, that Tyson has had to hire lawyers. Lots of lawyers 'cause he keeps getting into trouble - What happened here? for [18.biting] Evander Holyfield's ear, for [19.being convicted of] [20.rape], for getting into fights at bars and hotels for [21.non-payment] of taxes for [22.filing bankruptcy].

Lawyers have cost Tyson millions, but is he embarrassed or regretful a year ago? Anyway, he told ESPN Not at all. I never dreamed of living this long. I never dreamed of [23.fornicating] with as many as beautiful women as I did, or having as much money as I did. And having as beautiful and intelligent kids as I did, so if I was to die tomorrow, I've won. I've won. Even if the money's gone, he said then, I've won.
