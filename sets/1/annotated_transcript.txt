Well, after a day out at the [1.temple fair], [2.setting off] [3.fireworks] and [4.firecrackers] at night is also a [5.quintessential] part of a spring festival all over China. But where exactly does it come from in Chinese [6.legend]?

Well, going back thousands of years, there... People believed it was a [7.ferocious] monster called Nian, and he lived at the bottom of the deep sea, but would come [8.ashore] on New Year's Eve to [9.devour] cattle and people, and [10.cause havoc].

In an effort to [11.repel] this terrifying beast, the people... will throw bamboo [12.cane] into a fire and then they discovered gunpowder and found the firecrackers were more effective. And the celebration of Chinese New Year is also called guo nian, which means to pass or survive the nian. And it's from this that the tradition of setting off fireworks and firecrackers originated nowadays.

People do it as a means of entertainment as well as a time to pray for happiness and [13.prosperity].
