# Text 1: American football

## Transcript


For a long time, baseball was the most popular sport in the United States. But now, football is probably the most popular sport. It is also very popular in Canada.  In the fall, students in high schools and colleges and professional players all over the country play football.  Football players wear strange looking **uniforms** to protect them because it is a rough game, which can be dangerous.

The object, or goal of the game, is to carry the football from one end of the field to the other.  Players can run with the ball, throw it, or sometimes even kick it to **score points**.  Now, most good high school football players can enter an American university easily.  The best college football players often become professional players.

Many professional players are rich and famous, but they usually don't play for more than six or eight years.  Football might be hard for most people to play, but it's certainly fun to watch. From September through January, people all over the country spend weekends and Monday nights in front of the TV set.

Football **widows** are wives who don't like to watch football. Of course, these women hate this time of year.
