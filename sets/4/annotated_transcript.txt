# Part 3: Dark secrets of the food industry

The industry changed the entire way that chicken are raised. Birds are now raised and [1.slaughtered] in half the time they were 50 years ago. But now they're twice as big. People like to eat white meat, so they redesigned the chicken to have large breasts.

They not only changed the chicken, they changed the farmer. Today, chicken farmers no longer control their birds. A company like Tyson owns the birds from the day they're [2.dropped off] until the day that they're slaughtered.


Let me go to the top. National Chicken Council. The chicken industry has really [3.set a model] for the [4.integration] of production and [5.processing] and marketing of the products that other industries are now following because they see that we have achieved [6.tremendous] economies.

In a way, we're not producing chickens. We're producing food. It's all highly [7.mechanized]. So all the birds coming off those farms have to be almost exactly the same size. What this system of [8.intensive] production [9.accomplishes], is to produce a lot of food, at a small amount of land, at a very [10.affordable] price. Now somebody explain to me what's wrong with that.

Smells like money to me.

16 chicken houses sit here. And Chuck’s son has four over the top of this hill. The chicken industry came in here, and it’s helped this whole community out. Here’s my chicken houses here. I have about 300,000 chickens.

We have a [11.contract] with Tyson. They've been growing chickens for many, many years, and it's all a science. They got it figured out. If you could grow a chicken in 49 days, why would you want one you gotta grow in three months. More money in your pocket.

These chickens never see [12.sunlight]. They're pretty much [13.in the dark] all the time.

Do you think they just want to keep us out.

If I knew I'd tell you. It would be nice if y'all could see what we really do. But you know, but as far as y'all going in, that's, we can't let you do that.

I understand why farmers don't want to talk, um, because the company can do what it wants to do as far as [14.pay] goes, since they control everything. Um, but it's just gotten to the point that it's not right what's going on, and I've just made up my mind, I'm going to say what I have to say. Um, I understand why others don't want to do it.

And I'm just to the point that it doesn't matter anymore. Something has to be said.

It is [15.nasty] in here. There's dust flying everywhere. There's [16.feces] everywhere. This isn't fun. This isn’t [17.farming]. This is just [18.mass production] like an [19.assembly line] in a factory. When they grow from a chick, and in seven weeks you've got a five and a half pound chicken, their bones and their [20.internal organs] can't keep up with the rapid growth.

A lot of these chickens here, they can take a few steps. And then they [21.plop down]. It's because they can't keep up with all the [22.weight] that they're carrying.

That's normal.

There's [23.antibiotics] that's put into the [24.feed], and of course that passes through the chicken.

The [25.bacteria] [26.builds up] a [27.resistance], so antibiotics aren't working anymore. I have become [28.allergic] to all antibiotics and can't take them.
