On the 25th of April each year, Australia and New Zealand celebrate Anzac Day when they [1.commemorate] all the members of the Australian and New Zealand [2.Army Corps] who died in action during the First and Second World Wars, and in every [3.armed conflict] since then. We're here now at the Australian War [4.Memorial] at the start of the [5.Dawn] Service.

They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old. Age shall not [6.weary] them. Nor the years [7.condemn], at the going down of the sun, and in the morning, we will remember them, [8.lest] we forget.

A [9.verse] from the poem, [10.Ode] to Remembrance, by Lawrence Binyon, is [11.recited] during the ceremony.

> ... O we are young and free, In history's page letter we see...

Inside the Hall of Memory is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. This is the grave of a soldier whose identity is not known, and it represents all those soldiers who died in battle, but were not identified.

> 24 years after the [12.ravages] of World War I, war came to the mainland of Australia, where [13.air raids] killed hundreds of [14.service personnel] and [15.civilians]. In Malaya, Korea and Vietnam, we answered the call, as we have in Afghanistan and Iraq. Through it all, the one [16.unshakable] truth has been a [17.steadfastness] born of the traditions of the Australian servicemen. Today, Australia's special day. They remember in East Timor, on Bougainville, in Afghanistan and Iraq, on the island of Crete, at Gallipoli. They, along with us, remember.

Anzac Day is a public holiday in Australia. It is one of the most important national days of the year, and certainly the most [18.solemn] one.

[19.Commemoration] services are held in all the major cities in Australia, and huge crowds attend to pay their respects to those who died.

Servicemen and women from all the armed services in Australia march in [20.procession].

They fought in the Second World War and other conflicts since then that have happened around the world.

The men in the [21.trucks] are all wearing decorations. They're [22.veterans] from the Second World War, and perhaps a few last survivors from the First World War.

After the [23.parade], the veterans will gather in a pub or club to talk and share memories.

This veteran fought in the Second World War in Western Australia.

> And what does ANZAC Day mean to you? Well, it means, uh, remembering not only those that didn't go home, but, uh, the, uh, the fact, uh, that you've, uh, keep in touch with a lot of your, uh, friends.
