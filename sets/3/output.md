But if you know what to look for, you can use your own **senses** to make weather predictions. There are many signs that can help you. For example, in fair weather, the air pressure is generally high, the air is **still** and often full of dust, and far away objects may look **vague**.

But when a storm is **brewing**, the pressure drops, and you are often able to see things more clearly. **Sailors** **took note of** this long ago, and came up with the saying, The farther the **sight**, the nearer the rain.

Your sense of smell can also help you **detect** weather changes. Just before it rains, **odors** become stronger. This is because odors are **repressed** in a fair high pressure center. When a bad weather **low** moves in, air pressure **lessens** and odors are released. You can also hear an **approaching** storm. Sounds **bounce off** heavy storm clouds and return to Earth with increased force.

An old saying describes it this way. Sound traveling far and wide, a **stormy** day will **betide**. And don't laugh at your grandmother if she says she can feel a storm coming. It is commonly known that many people feel pains in their bones or **joints** where the **humidity** rises. The pressure drops. And bad weather is on the way.
