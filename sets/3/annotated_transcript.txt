To find out what the weather is going to be, most people go straight to the radio, television, or newspaper to get an [1.expert] weather forecast. But if you know what to look for, you can use your own [2.senses] to make weather predictions. There are many signs that can help you. For example, in fair weather, the air pressure is generally high, the air is [3.still] and often full of dust, and far away objects may look [4.vague].

But when a storm is [5.brewing], the pressure drops, and you are often able to see things more clearly. [6.Sailors] [7.took note of] this long ago, and came up with the saying, The farther the [8.sight], the nearer the rain.

Your sense of smell can also help you [9.detect] weather changes. Just before it rains, [10.odors] become stronger. This is because odors are [11.repressed] in a fair high pressure center. When a bad weather [12.low] moves in, air pressure [13.lessens] and odors are released. You can also hear an [14.approaching] storm. Sounds [15.bounce off] heavy storm clouds and return to Earth with increased force.

An old saying describes it this way. Sound traveling far and wide, a [16.stormy] day will [17.betide]. And don't laugh at your grandmother if she says she can feel a storm coming. It is commonly known that many people feel pains in their bones or [18.joints] where the [19.humidity] rises. The pressure drops. And bad weather is on the way.
