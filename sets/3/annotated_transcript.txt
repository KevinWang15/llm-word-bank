# Part 2 Text 2: College Diet

With all their classes, [1.tuition bills], and homework, many college students don't make eating right a [2.priority]. When I have a lot of tests, or I have to do a lot of studying, I have to get something fast. For lunch, it's really whatever I can [3.grab]. I usually eat [4.snacks]. Fast foods, like french fries, [5.chicken tenders], and hamburgers are college dining halls' most popular items, according to recent [6.surveys].

Carol Kelly, a [7.nutritionist] at Emory University, gave us a lesson in College Diets [8.101].

"Students will choose foods that are quick and easy to eat, [9.on the run], and sometimes that comes [10.at the expense of] having more balance with their diet." Kelly says college dining services have [11.catered to] student demands for healthier choices, but [12.honey buns] and hamburgers are still the [13.grab and go] favorite.

"The variety is definitely there. They have everything from [14.stir-fries] to fast foods to hot meals that include vegetables. [15.Abundant] [16.salad bars]. However, students still typically will select what they, um, know as familiar and [17.tasty] to them." Kelly says college students aren't [18.invincible] to the [19.consequences] of unhealthy diets.

The Centers for Disease Control reported in their last survey of American college students that one in five students was overweight. "Students may be developing a [20.template], a [21.nutritional] template, a pattern that they're going to take with them into adulthood. Nutrition is involved with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, possibly [22.diabetes], um, possibly [23.hypertension]."

So students, the lesson for the day is talk to your college nutritionist about your diet. In the meantime, here are some simple changes you can make to eat healthier on any college campus.

"Instead of having simply... Um, [24.pepperoni pizza], two or three [25.slices] of that, maybe have one slice along with the salad. Snacks such as [26.nuts] and [27.seeds] along with fresh fruit." I hope you took good notes because this will all be on the final. For Feeling Fit, I'm Elizabeth Cohen.
